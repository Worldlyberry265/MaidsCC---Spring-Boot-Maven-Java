-To run the application, we run the root folder as Spring Boot App.

-All the APIs can be called using Postman through the mentioned URLs, except for the login
one, it can be accessed through "api/patron/login" and the body should be the id of the 
patron and his/her password.

-The Tests can be run by running ApiControllerTests as JUnit Test.

-The Login method will take the id and the pass, it will hash the pass, and then compare
it with the hashed password in the database. Upon successful authentication, it will 
generate a JWT.

-To try the jwt, we can pass with the update request for example an authorization header
that has an Auth Type of Bearer Token, where the actual jwt is placed after "Bearer ",
and then the jwt filter will handle its validation.

-The SQL statements that were used to create the database can be found in a file called
SQL Statements.txt.
